              <h4>Experience</h4>
              <p>Since I was 16 I am in the world of technology, which I did not know to develop, but to repair computer equipment. Over the years I have been getting into software development issues until I leave the technical aspect to the logical one.</p>
              <p>I have a lot of experience in mobile development for the two best known platforms (iOS / Android) and the creation of web services. I am currently researching and developing IT topics.</p>

                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>I always find motivation when I see there is something I can improve on, and learn it to the maximum and share my knowledge in the courses I teach during the year.</p>
                <p>I am motivated to acquire knowledge and share with other people, create study groups and socialize with people who know other ideologies regarding X topic.</p>
